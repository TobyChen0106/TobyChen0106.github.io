Education
======
* M.S. in Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, 2022
* B.S. in Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, 2020
* Courses: Robotics, Computer‑aided Engineering Drawing, Optimization in Engineering, Linear System, Neuro‑control Systems, Precision Motion Control, Machine Learning


Research Experience
======
* Next‑generation Automated Surgical Apparatus Lab, NTU, Prof. Cheng‑Wei Chen (2020 ‑ 2022)
  * The infant Cardiac Robotic System (iCROSS) [[1]](https://tobychen0106.github.io/publications/infant-Cardiac-Robotic-Surgical-System-(iCROSS))
    1. Defined the clinical specifications for the proposed robot‑assisted pediatric cardiac surgery
    2. Designed and built the system, which can adapt general instruments and collaborate within one single small incision
    3. Evaluate the performance of the system in terms of workspace, accuracy, precision, and latency in teleoperation; perform dry‑lab experiments on an infant model generated from CT scans
  * The intraOcular RoBotic Interventional System (iORBIS) [[2]](https://tobychen0106.github.io/publications/intraOcular-Robotic-Interventional-System-(iORBIS))
    1. Solved the existing backlash issue by using a tension spring mechanism
    2. Solved the unstable joint issue by designing a new adapter for one of the actuators
* International Center of Excellence in Intelligent Robotics and Automation Research (iCeiRA), NTU, Prof. Ren C. Luo (2018 ‑ 2019)
  * The UarmBot
    1. Designed and built an 8‑axis quadruped robot integrated with a 5‑axis robotic arm, aiming at performing general tasks
    2. Integrated the system with 3D vision system and implemented SLAM function using ROS
  * The BoxSpider
    1. Designed and built a 12‑axis quadruped robot that can fold itself into a small box; the robot is designed for field missions
    2. Integrated the system with 3D vision system and lidar for navigation
