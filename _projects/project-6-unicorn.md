I am a huge Gundam fan and building models is one of my favorite hobby. This work is built for the GBWC 2014, in which I won the 2nd place in the Taiwan tournament.

The Unicorn Gundam is one of my favorites, and I think the scene I built really showcases its beauty.

I spent about two months customizing every detail of the Unicorn Gundam, and the end result is truly stunning.
