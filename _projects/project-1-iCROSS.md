The infant Cardiac Robotic Surgical System (iCROSS) is developed to assist a surgeon in performing the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure and other infant cardiac surgeries.

The iCROSS consists of two manipulators. Each manipulator has 6 DoFs, including two prismatic joints (Joints 1 and 2) and four revolute joints (Joints 3--6). In particular, Joint 1 is actuated by a linear motor that creates a rapid response of translational movement. Joint 1 of both manipulators is coaxial as the two stators move along the same slider.

In particular, the Joint 5 uses the worm-gear-driven mechanism. This design reduces the size of the end-effector to only 16 mm, allowing the two instruments to get very close during operation. A tension spring compensates for the backlash of the worm gear.
