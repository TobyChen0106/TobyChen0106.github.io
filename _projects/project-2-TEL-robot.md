This is a robot we build to join the TEL 2020 Robot Competition. It is equipped with mecanum wheels, 4 DoF arms, a depth camera, a storage space with door. It is integrated with ROS and is capable of tasks like:

- Automated navigation in a prebuilt map;
- Object avoidance;
- Recognizes and localizes colored cubes;
- Picks up objects and stores them in the storage space.
