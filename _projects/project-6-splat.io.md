This is a final project for the Web Programming class. It is imspired by the Nintando game Splatoon--The goal is cover the floor with the player's color as much as possible; the weapon is a water gun filled with ink, and it can be used to color the floor or kill the enemy! This game is deployed using Heroku, and it allows a maximum of 8 player to join simultaneously.

In this project, I collaborated with 2 other teammembers, and is reponsible for the whole frontend development. The rendering uses only basic cavas functions, and whole game, including the physical system, is developed using JavaScript.
