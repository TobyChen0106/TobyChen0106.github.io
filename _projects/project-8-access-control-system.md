During the COVID-19 outbreak, daily temperature checks were required for everyone entering the university campus. Drawing on my abilities in system integration and prototyping, I initiated a team to develop an automated access-control system integrated with proximity sensors, a thermometer, a scanner,  the schoolâ€™s database, and security systems.

Collaboration between our team and the school helped deploy over 70 low-cost yet effective tracking systems across the campus, protecting more than 34,000 students and faculty members for over two months. Meanwhile, I mentored and led a group on the automated infant cardiac-surgery project. Besides tutoring the junior members of the team, my comprehensive research experiences allowed me to coordinate everyoneâ€™s research focus, thus contributing to the common goal.
