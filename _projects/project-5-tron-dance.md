This performance came on stage at EE Night show 2019, which is inspired by a [show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvrCyIZb5q8) on "Got Talent Global". The costume consists of Electroluminescence light and LEDs, and is driven by customized circuits; some special props are also included. Our system include real-time WI-FI connection to coordinate the dancers, aligning with the music. 

I was the leader of the tron dance team consists of around 15 members building the whole system from scratch. The whole system took us around three months to complete. It is definately one of the most amazing project I have participated in.
